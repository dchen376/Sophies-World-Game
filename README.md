this is the submission for the milestone 3 where we focused on the implementation of the game play.

The example run produced the below output:
"playgame() started.\n" + "File path entered correctly.\n"

side-note: based on my current design, my mock model and mock model testing was build on other mock model classes that I created (It was just the exact duplicate of the original classes).
